This repository contains shell functions and scripts I have created to make my life easier. If they are useful to you, feel free to use them.

NB: many functions are intended for use on the Partners HealthCare Research Computing ERISone cluster. Compatability in other contexts is not assured, and 
in fact is unlikely without some tweaking.
